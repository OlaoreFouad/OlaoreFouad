### Hello one two, hello tueh tueh, hello. (taps mic) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer currently working as an Intern at GlobalAccelerex Ltd. Currently based in Nigeria, I love taking up challenges, learning new things as days go by and at the same time, impacting people around me by exposing them to various concepts I feel needs to be explained and viewed from a better perspective.

I build applications for native mobile and web using the Android and Angular frameworks respectively. I have experience working in teams of highly skilled professionals and design-minded developers. I love collaborating with people to produce highly scalable and quality software. I also write  technical articles that help improve the community.

Getting better, one line of code and project at a time.
